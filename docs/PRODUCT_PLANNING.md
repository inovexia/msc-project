### Dashboard Design & UX Strategy

**Hybrid Approach: Dual-View System**

After evaluating multiple UX paradigms (Inbox-First, Client-Centric, Kanban, and Command Center), we've chosen a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of multiple designs to serve different workflow needs.

#### Primary View: Inbox-First Design (Daily Operations)

The default dashboard follows an **email paradigm** optimized for high-volume document processing:

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌─ Sidebar ──────┬─ Document List ────────┬─ Detail Panel ────┐
│ 📥 Inbox (42)  │ ☐ Invoice - ABC Corp   │ [Document Preview]│
│ ⏰ This Week   │   $2,450 • Oct 15      │                   │
│ 🔍 Needs Review│ ☐ Receipt - Office...  │ Vendor: ABC Corp  │
│ ✓ Approved     │   $125.50 • Oct 14     │ Amount: $2,450.00 │
│ 📁 By Client   │ ☐ Statement - Bank...  │ Date: Oct 15      │
│   - ABC Corp   │   $15,234 • Oct 1      │                   │
│   - XYZ Ltd    │ ☐ Receipt - Amazon...  │ [Approve] [Reject]│
│ 📅 By Month    │   $89.99 • Oct 12      │ [Edit Details]    │
│ 🏷️ By Type     │                        │                   │
└────────────────┴────────────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

**Key Features:**
- **Three-column layout**: Sidebar navigation, document list, detail panel
- **Bulk selection and actions**: Select and approve/reject multiple documents at once
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Navigate (j/k), select (x), approve (e), reject (r)
- **Smart filters**: Inbox, This Week, Needs Review, Approved, By Client, By Month, By Type
- **Checkbox-based selection**: Multi-select for batch operations
- **Quick actions on hover**: Preview, approve, reject without opening detail panel
- **Real-time updates**: Documents update status immediately
- **Search and advanced filters**: Find documents across all fields

**Why Inbox-First:**
- Solves immediate pain point: processing documents quickly
- Familiar mental model (everyone understands email interfaces)
- Enables high-volume processing (100+ documents/day)
- Keyboard shortcuts make power users extremely efficient
- Linear workflow matches daily document triage needs

#### Secondary View: Client-Centric Design (Month-End Overview)

Toggle to **client-focused view** for strategic oversight and month-end planning:

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌─ Top Nav: [📥 Inbox View] [👥 Client View] • Filters & Search ┐
├─ Month-End Status Bar ────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ October 2025 • 15 days remaining • 68% complete               │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                │
│ ┌─ ABC Corp ─────────────────┐  ┌─ XYZ Ltd ──────────────┐   │

#### View Toggle & Navigation Flow

**Seamless switching between perspectives:**
```
Inbox View (default) → Process documents quickly
     ↕️
Client View → See month-end progress
     ↕️
Drill into specific client → See all their documents
     ↕️
Back to Inbox View → Continue processing
```

**User Scenarios:**

1. **Daily processing workflow:**
   - Start in Inbox View
   - Process new documents as they arrive
   - Use keyboard shortcuts for speed
   - Bulk approve similar documents

2. **Week 3-4 of month (month-end prep):**
   - Switch to Client View
   - Identify clients with incomplete submissions
   - Send reminders for missing documents
